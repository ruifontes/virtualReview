[[!meta title="VirtualRevision"]]

* Authors: Rui Batista and NVDA Addon Team
* Download: [version 1.3-dev][1]

This Addon allows NVDA users to review a Window content in a text box, similar to window virtualization of JAWS for Windows. Note, however, that this is just a convenience for users and "do not" replace NVDA's excellent flat review and object navigation support.

Press nvda+control+w to open the virtual revision Window. Then simply navigate the shown textbox as you do in any other text content.
